The sharing functionality will be implemented as a button within the game interface.

When a player clicks the share button, they will be redirected to the social media platform of their choice. The game will automatically generate a post with the player's progress or high score, along with a message promoting the game. This will allow players to easily share their achievements with their social circles, increasing the game's visibility and popularity.

By implementing this system, the game will benefit from increased user acquisition and engagement on the WeChat mini program platform, ultimately leading to the successful achievement of the objective of creating a popular airplane shooting game on WeChat mini program platform.
